# A keyboard for small hands

I have really small hands that have given me issues over the past few years

###### Project Details
Our journey began with the goal of exploring users' mental models around typing with a traditional QWERTY keyboard. We aimed to see how they would adapt to Kloa's innovative layout, designed to simplify search by grouping letters together. This unique approach minimizes the need for precise typing, addressing common issues with smaller touch targets.
