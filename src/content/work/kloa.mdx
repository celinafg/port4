  The Problem
  ### How flexible are users mental models around typing interface?
  Results from previous research and diary studies revealed that users had difficulties adopting the new keyboard layout. Our study focused on two hypotheses:

  <NumberedList>
    <NumberedItem index={0}>
      ###### Can we introduce the experience in a new way?
      If users don't think of KLOA as a keyboard, they won't try and use it like a QWERTY keyboard
    </NumberedItem>
    <NumberedItem index={1}>
      ###### What can onboarding to help?
      Effective onboarding can enable users to successfully use KLOA (a variation of "best case" testing)
    </NumberedItem>
  </NumberedList>

Research
### What are we testing?
We tested the latest release at that time, but taped over the search input field and the word ribbon. We convered these UI elements ot mimic similar changes in KLOA's most recent design explorations.

### One Pager

We created a one-pager describing key features, across the native shopping UI and KLOA's UI. Participants were asked to read the one pager as part of their first task.



### What did we want to learn?

1. What effect would priming participants have on their experience (i.e. prefacing it as a new search experience vs. new keyboard layout)
2. How willing will participants be to learn how to use KLOA
3. Barriers and frustrations participants encounter when using KLOA in the context of mobile app shopping

### Who do we want to learn from?

> ##### Why mixed methods?
>
> <p>Using mixed methods was a strategic choice for this project, because it incorporated the "what" from quantitative data with the "why" from qualitative insights,. Together this provided a more nuanced view of user frustration, why it happens, and to what degree they might be frustrated, which was valuable information for an early stage company and product. The quantiative methods allowed us to provide concerete numerical data that helped in identifying areas of difficulty using the itnerface, and to what degree. The qualitative data enriched these findings by adding context and depth to quantiative findings. Taking these quantiative findings during the interview also allowed us to probe more about their experience, expectations, and difficulties with this new search mental model.</p>

### What were the tasks?

1. **Warm up**: consent and warm up questions about online shopping experience.
2. **Task 1**: Participants read a one-pager about KLOA, setting the stage for Task 2 and gauging preconceived usability perceptions.
3. **Task 2**: Used the think-aloud method to explore KLOA's search on the Instacart app, observing initial interactions.
4. **Post task questions**
5. **Task 3**: Find 4 items (we provided the words apples, onions, broccoli, sparkling water on a tablet for them to reference)
6. **Evaluation**: Post task questionnaire (User Burden Scale) assessing difficulty of use was given, as well as likert questions on likelihood of use and advocacy. Administering these during the sessions allowed us to probe on their scored answers.

## Analysis and Findings

We used Sauro's severity scale because our tasks were broad and not complex, making it better suited for our case. At request, I can provide the more exhaustive and comprehensive documentation on these issues. At the client's request, I have hiddent the level rating for each finding and summarized some insights.

1. **I like the efficient contextual search results**

   Users appreciated quick and relevant search suggestions, highlighting the potential of KLOA's algorithm.

2. **I need more instructions and information:**

   Difficulty remembering instructions and understanding keyboard layout indicated need for more intuitive and accessible guidance.

3. **Willingness to learn vs. usability challenges**

   Although users were open to learning, the interface's complexity and the effort required were deterrents.

4. **Innovative yet confusing:**

   The novelty of KLOA was recognized, byt the interface usability issues hindered its acceptance.

5. **I need feedback while typing**:

   Critical for usability, the lack of immediated typing and feedback with the confusing layout significantly impacted the user experience.

6. **Layout confusion:**

   Participants felt frustrated by the experience and preferred QWERTY

## Opportunities

1. The search experience is more than input. How might KLOA take into consideration other aspects of the search experience?

   During the unguided exploration, 3/5 participants decided to scroll and browse isntead of using the search functionality. When asked about feedback on the "search experience", they would talk about the whole experience of shopping on the app.

1. Enhance onboarding and instructional materials to better acquaint users with the interface
1. Reconsider key placements and provide clear feedback to align with user expectations
1. Optimize suggestion algorithm to consistently deliver quick and relevant results, enhancing the perceived valueof KLOA.

## Limitations

Given the time constraints, we had a small sample size, and participants were mostly in the tech industry. Our focus was on testing whether priming users through a one pager could make the experience better. A one pager is not the only form of priming that can be done - future studies can consider testing the level of information needed as well as format of the information (tooltips, labels, videos). If the study is conducted with a printed paper, we would suggest asking the participants to read it aloud.

We would also recommend to run the test with an experienced and familiar user, to make sure that testing is "best case". Due to participant selection and recruitment (KLOA is not used yet in the market), we were not able to recruit and expert user. Being able to test on an expert and familiar user, and understanding whether tasks can be completed would be a good data point to consider.

## Reflection

1. Working with an early stage product
2. Understanding mental models
