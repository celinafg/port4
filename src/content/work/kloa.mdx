# Redefining Typing: Testing Mental Models with Kloa's Innovative Keyboard

:::div{className="description"}
Kloa is on a mission to revolutionize search by introducing a novel keyboard and contextual algorithm. We set out to understand how users adapt to this new typing experience.
:::


###### Project Details
Our journey began with the goal of exploring users' mental models around typing with a traditional QWERTY keyboard. We aimed to see how they would adapt to Kloa's innovative layout, designed to simplify search by grouping letters together. This unique approach minimizes the need for precise typing, addressing common issues with smaller touch targets.

The Challenge 
  ### How flexible are users mental models around typing interface?
  Results from previous research and diary studies revealed that users had difficulties adopting the new keyboard layout. Our study focused on two hypotheses:We wanted to understand if framing Kloa's keyboard as a new search experience, rather than just a new typing tool, would help users adapt more quickly and effectively.

      ###### Can reintroducing Kloa's keyboard as a unique tool change user behavior?

    <NumberedItem index={1}>
      ###### How effective can onboarding be in facilitating user adaptation?
      Effective onboarding can enable users to successfully use KLOA (a variation of "best case" testing)

Research
### Using a one pager
Our research process was designed to immerse users in the Kloa experience. We tested the latest release by covering standard UI elements to simulate design changes. Participants were given a one-pager outlining key features of both the native shopping UI and Kloa's UI, setting the stage for our evaluation tasks.

> **Note:** To avoid biasing the tests, we did not introduce ourselves as working with the company. This had some interesting effects on the results you can read about here.

Participants engaged in a series of tasks designed to explore their interactions with Kloa's interface:
1. **Warm-up**: Questions about their online shopping experiences.
2. **Task 1**: Reading a one-pager about Kloa to gauge initial perceptions.
3. **Task 2**: Using the think-aloud method to explore Kloa's search feature on the Instacart app.
4. **Task 3**: Finding specific items using the Kloa interface.
5. **Evaluation**: Completing a post-task questionnaire to assess difficulty, likelihood of use, and advocacy.


#### Key Learnings
We discovered several critical insights through our user interviews:

1. **Efficient Search Results**: Users appreciated the quick and relevant suggestions provided by Kloa's algorithm.
2. **Need for More Guidance**: Users struggled with the new layout, indicating a need for more intuitive and accessible instructions.
3. **Learning Curve**: Although users were willing to learn, the complexity of the interface was a significant deterrent.
4. **Novel Yet Confusing**: While users recognized the novelty of Kloa, usability issues hindered their acceptance.
5. **Feedback While Typing**: The lack of immediate feedback during typing sessions impacted the overall user experience.
6. **Layout Confusion**: Users expressed frustration with the new layout, showing a preference for the traditional QWERTY keyboard.

### Opportunities for Improvement
Our findings revealed several opportunities for Kloa to enhance its user experience:

- **Enhance Onboarding**: Develop more comprehensive instructional materials to better acquaint users with the new interface.
- **Reevaluate Key Placements**: Adjust key placements and provide clearer feedback to align with user expectations.
- **Optimize the Suggestion Algorithm**: Ensure the algorithm consistently delivers quick and relevant results, enhancing the perceived value of Kloa.
- **Consider the Broader Search Experience**: Take into account the entire search experience, not just the input method.

### Learnings 
We would also recommend to run the test with an experienced and familiar user, to make sure that testing is "best case". Due to participant selection and recruitment (KLOA is not used yet in the market), we were not able to recruit and expert user. Being able to test on an expert and familiar user, and understanding whether tasks can be completed would be a good data point to consider.


1. Working with an early stage product
2. Understanding mental models

### Final Thoughts and Future Directions
Working with Kloa provided invaluable insights into user adaptability and mental models. Moving forward, testing with experienced users could provide additional "best case" insights, helping to refine the Kloa interface further.

Our experience highlights the importance of:

- Collaborating on early-stage product development.
- Deepening our understanding of user mental models.
