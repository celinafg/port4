# Redefining Typing: Testing Mental Models with Kloa's Innovative Keyboard

:::div{className="description"}
Kloa is on a mission to revolutionize the way we search by introducing a new interface: a novel keyboard layout with larger targets and an algorithm predicting your next letter. We set out to understand and navigate users mental models around typing.
:::


###### Project Details
Our journey began with the goal of exploring users' mental models around typing with a traditional QWERTY keyboard. We wanted to find out 1) how flexible are users mental models around typing 2) how might we leverage the onboarding process to introduce this product in a more digestible way?

The Challenge 
  ### How flexible are users mental models around typing?
  Results from previous research and diary studies revealed that users had difficulties adopting the new keyboard layout. Our study focused on understanding how people search (ex. active search using the searchbar to find items vs. passive search like browsing through categories) and these two aspects: 

  <NumberedList>
    <NumberedItem index={0}>
      ###### Reintroducing the keyboard as a new search expereince 
      Can reintroducing Kloa as a new search experience instead of as a new keyboard layout help users manage their expectations and navigate the product more easily?
      
    </NumberedItem>
    <NumberedItem index={1}>
      ###### Testing onboarding materials
      How effective can onboarding be learning the new interface?

Research
### Onboarding
<div class="two-col">
<div>
###### Keeping it simple
We made it very simple so we could concentrate on the content vs how it might be presented (ex. tooltips etc). 
<br/>
###### What we tested
We tested the latest working release of the produc with some adjustments to the physical screen (taped over parts to be removed) in order to mirror upcoming design changes that were not yet implemented.

> **Note:** To avoid biasing results, we did not introduce ourselves as working with Kloa, but instead that we were a new search experience that was integrating with Instacart, which would be Kloa's ideal use case in the future.

#### Tasks 
1. **Warm-up**: Questions about their online shopping experiences. Probed an tahcteyive slashed. We gave them paasfesivew minutes to explore the product.
2. **Task 1**: Reading a one-pager about Kloa to gauge initial perceptions.
3. **Task 2**: Using the think-aloud method to explore Kloa's search feature on the Instacart app.
4. **Task 3**: Finding specific items using the Kloa interface.
5. **Evaluation**: Completing a post-task questionnaire to assess difficulty (user burden scale), likelihood of use, and advocacy.

#### Key Learnings
We discovered several critical insights through our user interviews:

1. **Efficient Search Results**: Users appreciated the quick and relevant suggestions provided by Kloa's algorithm.
2. **Need for More Guidance**: Users struggled with the new layout, indicating a need for more intuitive and accessible instructions.
3. **Learning Curve**: Although users were willing to learn, the complexity of the interface was a significant deterrent.
4. **Novel Yet Confusing**: While users recognized the novelty of Kloa, usability issues hindered their acceptance.
5. **Feedback While Typing**: The lack of immediate feedback during typing sessions impacted the overall user experience.
6. **Layout Confusion**: Users expressed frustration with the new layout, showing a preference for the traditional QWERTY keyboard.

### Opportunities for Improvement
Our findings revealed several opportunities for Kloa to enhance its user experience:

- **Enhance Onboarding**: Develop more comprehensive instructional materials to better acquaint users with the new interface.
- **Reevaluate Key Placements**: Adjust key placements and provide clearer feedback to align with user expectations.
- **Optimize the Suggestion Algorithm**: Ensure the algorithm consistently delivers quick and relevant results, enhancing the perceived value of Kloa.
- **Consider the Broader Search Experience**: Take into account the entire search experience, not just the input method.

### Learnings 
We would also recommend to run the test with an experienced and familiar user, to make sure that testing is "best case". Due to participant selection and recruitment (KLOA is not used yet in the market), we were not able to recruit and expert user. Being able to test on an expert and familiar user, and understanding whether tasks can be completed would be a good data point to consider.


1. Working with an early stage product
2. Understanding mental models
