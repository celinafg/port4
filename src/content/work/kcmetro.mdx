### Reflecting on the experience
1. making tools is fun 
2. working in governtment is very tactical 
3. understanding stakeholder buy in and how and who to go to for what 
4. a lesson in memorization: terms and codes that are used within the organization 
6. meeting great people and working with people who really care about their work!
