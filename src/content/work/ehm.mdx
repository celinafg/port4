The Discovery
### Unearthing Hidden Insights

**Digging Deeper into Museum Dynamics**
We embarked on a comprehensive research journey to understand EHM’s challenges and opportunities:

- **Desk Research**: Analyzing academic journals, industry reports, and community insights.
- **Field Observations**: Observing visitors and museum operations firsthand.
- **Interviews**: Engaging with stakeholders, volunteers, and community members.
- **Surveys**: Collecting feedback from the local community and museum visitors.

Key Insights
### Understanding the Visitor Experience

**Identifying Core Issues and Opportunities**
Our research revealed five crucial insights:

1. **Visitor Archetypes**: Defined motivations, identifying Explorers, Facilitators, Experience Seekers, Professional/Hobbyists, and Rechargers.
2. **Exhibit Functionality**: Highlighted issues like poor lighting and unclear signage.
3. **Community Awareness**: High awareness but low active recommendation.
4. **Interactive Preferences**: Visitors craved engaging, hands-on experiences.
5. **Volunteer Engagement**: High community volunteerism but low museum volunteer engagement.
